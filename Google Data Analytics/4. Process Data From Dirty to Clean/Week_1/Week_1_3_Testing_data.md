1. Hypothesis testing - Are there enough values in the sample size to draw an conclusion on the population. 

2. Confidence level - IF your sample size refletcs the population or not.
Ex - a 95% confidence level means that if you were to run the same survey 100 times, you would get similar results 95 of those 100 times. 
Industry standards - 95 and above.
95% Chance that everyone will lie between [56,64]

3. Margin of error - Since a sample is used to represent a population, the sampleâ€™s results are expected to differ from what the result would have been if you had surveyed the entire population. (This is the maximum number )

4. Statistical significance - This means that the result of the tests are real and did not happen by chance. A high degree of statistical significance indicates that an observed relationship is unlikely to be due to chance.(0-1)
Usually we need 80 percent stat power or above. Industry standards 90 and above (Depends upon the industry)

Population - sample size = margin of error

5. Estimated response rate: If you are running a survey of individuals, this is the percentage of people you expect will complete your survey out of those who received the survey.
    For example, if you need a sample size of 100 individuals and your estimated response rate is 10%, you will need to send your survey to 1,000 individuals to get the 100 responses you need for your analysis.

6. Confidence Interval - the probability that a population parameter will fall between a set of values for a certain proportion of times. Analysts often use confidence intervals that contain either 95% or 99% of expected observations.
