Data visualisations
Pictures tell the best story 

Steps to plan a data visualization

Step 1: Explore the data for patterns
Here we decide what are the key factors that we want to highlight with our visualisations

Step 2: Plan your visuals
Check the audience and what would they be most comfortable in learning 
Check the data and ask a SME to check the insights that you have highlighted 

Step 3: Create your visuals
Try more than one visualisation 
Always good to take a lehmans advice on this step as they can look at it without any bias
