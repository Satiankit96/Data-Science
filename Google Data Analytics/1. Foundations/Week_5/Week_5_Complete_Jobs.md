Case Study 1 
The process was fair since all the teachers were given the opportunity to attend the seminar. Apart from that the data was collected from an unbiased domain so none of it could be partial.
To improve the same, it is important to know what was asked in the survey and on what the teachers were graded on. Apart from that everything looks good.

Case Study 2 
This was an example of unfair practices.
All the places that are mentioned, do not include traffic as well as pedestrian. For the car to launch in such areas the car should be safe.
The data analyst should get the data when the car is tested on some roadways with some other vehicles, pedestrians, road signs etc.

Case Study 3 
This is an unfair practice.
They want to increase there customer acquisition and not maintain the ones that they have. The data does not show anything about the people who are not present on the time.
The analyst can make this form a bit more public so that they can get more data  and make a more informed decision.

Keep in mind the responsibility about the people from whom the data is collected from
