5. Bar Chart - Use these where we have to show the rank of the data.
6. Histogram - This is to show the data and the ranges in which it falls.
7. Corelational data - Corelational charts where we can see Causation are important

Creating Powerfull visualisations 
- Where to focus the attention of the audience. (try to keep the Viz precise )
- How is data distributed 

Static - They do not change over a period of time.

Dyanamic Visualisations - Interactive and change over time. 
This is much better as we can make changes with what we want to see 
We give most of the control to the user and they decide what data/trends that they want to see 
To choose between the two we should always see what is the data on hand and who we are presenting it to
