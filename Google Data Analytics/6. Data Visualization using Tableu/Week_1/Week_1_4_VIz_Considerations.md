Making it easier to understand.
Headlines - To highlight key data. Attention graber. The title. Keep it simple but Bold. No caps 
Sub titles - Directly under the headline giving more info about the Viz.
Labels - They are the values that directly attach to each viz.

Legends. They are written away from values as an index and are difficult to understand.
KEY _ USer should do the least amount of work.

Accessible Viz
Labeling - Much better than legends 
Text alternatives - Additional texts 
Better Viz - To support the background colors to make the point that you want to make.
