I have had the privilege to work with small data sets. For me its all about the little details. 
There is a creativity side to what we can use the data for. I emphasize greatly on the small details in the data which smalls the biggest of issues. 
For example, I want my data to be sorted, cleaned and visually aligned to look at. Once everthing above mentioned is done and completed, after that 
I begin to ask question, confirm the data sources, re evaluate the problem statement and create a timeline with some milestones alongside them.

No I do not come up with the big question first. Honestly we would only know about what was the big picture when everything is completed. 
before that it is all about solving the primary goal and trying not to miss any of the small details.
