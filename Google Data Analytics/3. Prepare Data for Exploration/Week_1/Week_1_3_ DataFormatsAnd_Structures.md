With recent advancement in AI and ML the sorting of data has become easier however sometimes some of the data is weighed on a bit more which makes it a bit unfair. 


Data Model - A model that is used for organising data elements and shows how they are connected to each other. 
Data elements - Atomic pieces of data that consist of names numbers, etc.

Levels of Data Modeling (https://www.1keydata.com/datawarehousing/data-modeling-levels.html)
1. Conceptual - Lower extraction levels. Higher view of data. No technicatlities. Meant to just show how the data elements interact with each other.
2. Logical - One level lower extraction. Has all the details about the elements but not the tables themselves. 
3. Physical - These have all the above and the table names as well. Lowest layer of extraction. (View The diagram)
