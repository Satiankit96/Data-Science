The first step is to answer the following question. Is data analysis an important skill to be added to the current portfolio. The answer to this question for me is a resounding yes. Although having a good understanding about Data analysis is fundamental, we still need to address the big picture. What is the part that we want to be using our new skill on? For an individual like me, who has spent most of my time in software engineering, I wanted to take up this new skill because I believe that my true skills lie in problem definition rather than product development.

There are many key areas where I can use my skills to become an analyst. However with the knowledge that I have gained so far, you need data to become an analyst. The companies that have the most amounts of data are the banks, search engines and data brokers. To pursue a successful career we need to start big. In order to land a big job, it is important to finish a few certifications to wow our employers. I think this is where I am at in journey to become a successful data analyst. In order to stand out, I plan to do a weeks work in a day and jump to the next certification and soon start doing some free lance work at my college.
