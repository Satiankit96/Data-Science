Recently I have come in my final semester and need a job. I have kept a record of the entire job hunt on Excel. I have used multiple attributes such as date applied, referrals, Company name, status of application and the link to check the update on my application. 
This has been extremely useful for me as I have increased the number of calls and worked harder on my Resume depending upon the data available to me on the spreadsheet. 

Graph attached 
How did you use a spreadsheet to help prepare your data? 
1. I used the data about the amount of sleep I have had over the period of 10 days. After that I had traced the same over this graph and added a few visualizations of my own.

How did you format your chart to help you analyze your data? 
2. Late I created a trend line that showed the average amount of sleep that I have had over the period of 11 days. I also made the graph 3d and changed a few colors in the visualisation depending upon the hours hours I had slept that day.
