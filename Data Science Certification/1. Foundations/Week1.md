Using data to make data driven decisions.
- Impact of data on business driven organisations 
- Google was one of the very first companies to make a data driven decisions. They used this feature in a peoples analytics program.

Example 
Problem statement 
- A company wanted to find out the way that they could increase the retention rate of employees.

1. Ask 
Initially they wante dto know what could be the reason that a employee wanted to leave in the firt year. They asked a certain types of questions as mentioned below.

- What do you think new employees need to learn to be successful in their first year on the job? 

- Have you gathered data from new employees before? If so, may we have access to the historical data?

- Do you believe managers with higher retention rates offer new employees something extra or unique?

- What do you suspect is a leading cause of dissatisfaction among new employees?

- By what percentage would you like employee retention to increase in the next fiscal year?

2. Prepare 
Next 3 months were spent in the preparation phase of the project.
- In this step, they identifiend the exact data that they wanted to collect from the employees.
- They created un-ambigous question with simple ansewers.
- They choose the best visualisation techniques in order to view the data once they had the results.

3. Process
collected, stored, managed, and protected
In this step, it was the responsibilty of the analyst to protect the data as well as prepare it for the analysis step.
- In this process, we will figure out who shall have the access to the data. (Try to keep the number to a bare minimum)
- Clean the data of the values that add nothing to the decision making stage.
- Then the raw data needs to be uploaded for an aditional layer of security.

4. Analyse 
- Now we are at the main part of the process where we need to actually do the work.
- We need to figure out the prime reason that was pushing the employees to quit in the first year.
- It is better that many people work on this one simultaenously to get a better picture of what is going on.

Based upon the above 2 conclusions were found out 

a. Employees who experienced a long and complicated hiring process were most likely to leave the company. 

b. Employees who experienced an efficient and transparent evaluation and feedback process were most likely to remain with the company. 

5. Share
Now we need to share this report with the right people.

- In this case the rightr people are the reporting managers of new hirer, hiring managers and the HR.
- Then these results need to be shared by the mangers within their teams.

6. Act.
We need to collectively move towards achieveing that goal.
- The managerws need to be made aware about the data and the stratergies ahead.
- The hiring needs to be updated about the same.

CONCLUSION
In conclusion it was found out that there was an 125% increase in the retention rate of employees between 2 fiscal years.
