To my understanding the early parts of the project where data is prepared and processed take significantly longer than any other step. Initially the step where we are capturing data could take as long as the entire remaining life cycle of the project. In some of the scenarios we need to collect the data in real time in order to tackle a new issue. In this case we cannot use already existing data and must capture new data over the next period of months.
Similarly in the cases of data process, it is ideal to begin this simultaneously with the preparation stage. This is because over the life cycle the defination of the problem might evolve or change completely. In order to tackle these scenarios we need to clean the data to fit what is needed. Apart from that, this is the state where we should get some validation from the subject matter experts so that analysts mistakenly do not delete something that was meant to be of importance. 
I believe that the other 4 stages are more simpler and serve almost similar uses in different use cases barring a few exceptions.
