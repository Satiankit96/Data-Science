They depend upon the data. 
Tableu is one of the best examples 

Spreadsheets | Software applications | Structure data in a row and column format | Organize information in cells | Provide access to a limited amount of data | Manual data entry | Generally one user at a time | Controlled by the user
--- | --- | --- | --- |--- |--- |--- |--- 
Databases  | Data stores - accessed using a query language (e.g. SQL) | Structure data using rules and relationships | Organize information in complex collections | Provide access to huge amounts of data | Strict and consistent data entry | Multiple users | Controlled by a database management system
