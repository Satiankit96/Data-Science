Why are file structure and naming conventions so important? What are the consequences of poor organization for data analysts at work? 
When we are working in a team, it is important for everyone to be on the same page. Apart from being good for the analysis front, er have a much better direction of the dat and things that we have to do in order to achieve the goal. 
How would you structure folders and files? What naming conventions would you use?
Generally in an hierarchical order so that we have an idea of who does what. Apart from that we can sort the data with dates as well as regions.

What appeals to you about these choices?
This is much better in the future. Once we can get everything done we can still keep the data on hand and use it for next projects.
