Database features

Relational Database - A series of related tables connected via their relationships.
- One or more of the same fields must be there in both tables.

Normalisation 
- This is the way of sorting the data in a relational database.
1. Primary Key 
- primary key is an identifier that references a column in which each value is unique.
- They should exist in almost every table in order to make the job easier. 
- Every table can have only one primary key.
- It can have multiple Foreign Key. 

2. Foreign Key
- A field within a table that is a primary key in other table. 
- This is one way how a table can be connected to another table. 

3. Composite keys 
- This is a speacial scenario where a primary key is made out of two or more columns. 
- Values in both the columns are unique.
- Example - (PRIMARY KEY (rollNumber, mobile))
