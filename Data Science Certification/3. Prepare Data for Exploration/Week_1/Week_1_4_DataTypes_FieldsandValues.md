Data Type - Similar as we do in code.
- Number 
- Text/String
- Boolean

Data Tables - These are the simples ways to store a data element. 
Rows - Records - Horizontal that is informatioon about only one entity 
Column is fields - This will have all the similar data types in one singlke place. 


Wide vs Long Data 
Wide - This type of data has a lot of columns in it. It is very easy to view the different entitities through multiple columns. However this is generally not used as a small addition of coulumns could mean mean n times more additions.
Long Data - This is the way to counter the above issue. In this Way we will only need one more column to address any new issue. Apart from that it gives a much better understanding of data.
