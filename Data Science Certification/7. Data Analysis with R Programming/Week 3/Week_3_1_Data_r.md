R data frames 
This is a collection of columns 
- Columns should be named (as they will be used as variables in the code)
- data frames could have multiple data types 
- Each column should have the same number of data items ideally 

Tibbles - streamlined data frames 
- The data types of the inputs always remain constant 
- Never create variable names 
- pprinting is easier
