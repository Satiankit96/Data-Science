Course Content 
Data visualization: Data visualization is in many ways the culmination of the data analysis process.
Data visualizations with Tableau: Tableau is a tool that can help analysts create effective data visualizations.
Stories about your data: Connecting your objective with your data through insights is essential to good data storytelling. 
Developing presentations and slideshows: In this part of the course, you will discover how to give an effective presentation about your data analysis.

Key elements of any visualisation 
1. Information - The core data that is formulated 
2. Story - Concept and a roal towards conclusion 
3. Goal - The final conclusion
4. Visual Form - Beauty and Structure of visualisation 

Pre-attentive attributes:We know how the brain works and our aim is to follow what we know to make the representations as easy as possible.
We achieve the same following the below two.
Marks -  basic visual objects like points, lines, and shapes. 
- position
- size
- shape
- Color

Channels - Marks that are used for the data visualisation 

Principles of data Viz 
1. Choose the right visual - See what we want to show first. Take a hint from data and prev results
2. Optimize the data-ink ratio
3. Use orientation effectively - 
4. Color - Use the general use for colors and understand more as to where you want to lead the story
5. Numbers of things - Do not use bigger numbers. If you do pick a better visual tech

What to avoid

What Leads to poor visualisations -  
Question - Q - The premise for the entire analysis
Visual - v - The representation 
Data - D - The source of data 

Three issues.
- Cutting off the y-axis
- Misleading use of a dual y-axis
- Artificially limiting the scope of the data
- Problematic choices in how data is binned or grouped
- Using part-to-whole visuals when the totals do not sum up appropriately 
- Hiding trends in cumulative charts
- Artificially smoothing trends

Issues with effective analysis 

1. Singles - This means that one of the above mentioned have an issue and is going to hamper the overall analysis.
Types - 
Q(Unclear Premise), 
V(Poor Visualisation), 
D (Poor data). 
(It is to be noted that in each of the 3 cases the other two parts are well)

2. Doubles - This means that two of the above mentioned have an issue and is going to hamper the overall analysis.
Types 
QV - unclear premise and visualisation. (Same for below)
VD - 
QD - 

4. Trifecta - QVD
