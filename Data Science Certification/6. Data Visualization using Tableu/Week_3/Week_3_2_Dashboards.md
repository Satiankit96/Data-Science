Dashboard - a tool that organizes information, typically from multiple data sets, into one central location for tracking, analysis, and simple visualization through charts, graphs, and maps. And just like filters and spreadsheets and queries.

Outliers - We can remove a few outliers after creating filters. We should not remove much.
Keep only -n This is also one of the better ways to remove the data that is not part of the story. This way we can leave a few outliers in and investogate them later. 

WE can combine multiple sheets over here.
