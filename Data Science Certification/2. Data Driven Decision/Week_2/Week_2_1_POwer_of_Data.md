Data Driven Decisions - This is what we have learned till now. 
Using data and context to make a prediction for benefits.


Data Inspired Decisions - In this approach we look at multiple data sources to find out what they have in common.

Drawbacks of Data 
- We can still make bad decisions based on incomplete data.
- We can misinterpret the data to fit a narrative 
- Smaller datatset used to make an in accurate decision.

I.E - We should always define the problem statement first before we collect the data. Post this we should collect the datat that is relevant to ourresearch.

Examples of failures 
1. Coca Cola 
New coke replacing classic coke to get an edge over Pepsi.
Mistake - The data was only collected between the taste of new coke and Pepsoi. The impact of the taste of classsic coke was not factored in the equation.

2. Nasa 
They lost 125 million on the Mrs Orbiter 
 
Mistake 
NO one even checked if the data was calculated in the same units. We shall always have a SME to go over all the data that is collected before we should get to the act phase.

Examples of Success with DDD
1. Crate and Barrel 
When they resolved the problem of orders during the pandemic using the data.

2. Pepsico
   They made data there centeral approach to gain more and more market share.

Key takeaway
- We noticed how making decisions on incomplete data could create an issue.
