Margin of error - Since a sample is used to represent a population, the sample’s results are expected to differ from what the result would have been if you had surveyed the entire population. (This is the maximum number )
Study score = 60 
MoE - 4
Actual score = [56,64]
NOTE - if Actual score overlaps with 50%, Your score is in conclusive.
NOTE _ Confidence level and margion of error are indipendent of each other 
For calculation - Pop size, sample size and confidence level 

MOE = Zy * (x**2/n)**1/2

\text{MOE}	=	margin of error
y	=	confidence level
zy	=	quantile
x	=	standard deviation
{n}	=	sample size

Example - 
For example, suppose you are conducting an A/B test to compare the effectiveness of two different email subject lines to entice people to open the email. You find that subject line A: “Special offer just for you” resulted in a 5% open rate compared to subject line B: “Don’t miss this opportunity” at 3%. 

Does that mean subject line A is better than subject line B? It depends on your margin of error. If the margin of error was 2%, then subject line A’s actual open rate or confidence interval is somewhere between 3% and 7%. Since the lower end of the interval overlaps with subject line B’s results at 3%, you can’t conclude that there is a statistically significant difference between subject line A and B. Examining the margin of error is important when making conclusions based on your test results.
