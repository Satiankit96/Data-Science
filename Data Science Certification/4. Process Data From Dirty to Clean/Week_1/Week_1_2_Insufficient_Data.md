 Types of insufficient data 
1. Data from a single source - Check with the stakeholders 
2. Data keeps on updating - EIther increase the time or shift the objective.
3. Outdated data - Find a new data set 
4. Geographically limited dataset - Get more data 

You can identify trends with the available data or wait for more data if time allows
You can talk with stakeholders and adjust your objective
Or you can look for a new data set.

Some more solutions to data shortages 
1. Data issue 1: no data
   - Gather the data on a small scale to perform a preliminary analysis and then request additional time to complete the analysis after you have collected more data. 
   - If there isn’t time to collect data, perform the analysis using proxy data from other datasets. This is the most common workaround.

2. Data issue 2: too little data
   - Do the analysis using proxy data along with actual data.(If you are analyzing trends for owners of golden retrievers, make your dataset larger by including the data from owners of labradors.)
   - Adjust your analysis to align with the data you already have. (If you are missing data for 18- to 24-year-olds, do the analysis but note the following limitation in your report: this conclusion applies to adults 25 years and older only.)

3. Data issue 3: wrong data, including data with errors
   - If you have the wrong data because requirements were misunderstood, communicate the requirements again.
   - Identify errors in the data and, if possible, correct them at the source by looking for a pattern in the errors.
   - If you can’t correct data errors yourself, you can ignore the wrong data and go ahead with the analysis if your sample size is still large enough and ignoring the data won’t cause systematic bias. 
* Important note: sometimes data with errors can be a warning sign that the data isn’t reliable. Use your best judgment.
