Machine learning is the new Electricity of the world

Opportunities in the width that this can be used openened my eyes. For me I saw that within the data center framework.  

Key topics covered 
1. Supervised Learning 
   - It is a ML model trained on a set of labeled data, pairing input data with desired output. Upon establishing the relationship on trained and untrained data, we can use x to make predictions about y. 

   - Regression model - This is a statistical technique which is used to predict the value of a dependent variable based upon one or more independent variables.

    - Linear Regression
    - Polynomial Regression
    - Support Vector Machine Regression
    - Decision Tree Regression
    - Random Forest Regression
    NOTE - OP variable is a real value. 

    b. Classification problem - Uses labeled datasets in order to put things in category. 
    - Logistic Regression
    - Support Vector Machines
    - Decision Trees
    - Random Forests
    - Naive Baye 
    NOTE - O/P variable is a category 
    
2. Learning Theory 
3. Unsupervised Learning - This one is used for unlabeled datasets and we need to make sense out of that data.
4. Deep Learning 
5. Reinforcement learning
