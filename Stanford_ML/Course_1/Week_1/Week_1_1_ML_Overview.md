Artificial general intelligence (AGI) is a field of theoretical AI research that attempts to create software with human-like intelligence and the ability to self-teach.
AReas of use and Applications of ML 


Machine Learning -> Field of study that gives the computers the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed.
Machine learning is a branch of artificial intelligence (AI) and computer science which focuses on the use of data and algorithms to imitate the way that humans learn, gradually improving its accuracy.

- 

1. Supervised Learning (Most likely used in the real world) - The algorithm that learns a y from x using examples of correct answers. 
- It is a ML model trained on a set of labeled data, pairing input data with desired output. Upon establishing the relationship on trained and untrained data, we can use x to make predictions about y. 
- Prime goal is accuracy of a continous value 

2. Unsupervised Learning - This one is used for unlabeled datasets and we need to make sense out of that data.
3. Recommendation models 
4. Reinforcement learning

Supervised Learning (Most likely used in the real world) 
- The algorithm that learns a y from x using examples of correct answers. 
- It is a ML model trained on a set of labeled data, pairing input data with desired output. 
- Upon establishing the relationship on trained and untrained data, we can use x to make predictions about y. 
- We use the labeled data sets 

1. Regression
- We are predicting a continous value which is a real number. 
- The Main aim is to find the line of regression which can best fit the data and be used to make accurate predictions 

2. Classification 
- Small/finite number of classification model   
________________________X________________________________________
Unsupervised Learning 
- This one is used for unlabeled datasets. ( we only have a x without a y)
- This is not gererally used to predict a value, but to find something interesting about the data. 
- This generally used to divide the data into clusters.
- Acuuracy of category based on random values.
1. Clustering 
2. Anomaly detection - Unusual data points 
3. Dimensionality reduction - Reducing the data points
