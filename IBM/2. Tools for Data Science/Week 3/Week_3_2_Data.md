Machine Learning Models - Models are created by running data through a model with comute resources and SME.
Learning Model types
1. Supervised - Identifies the relationships between the input data and the correct data
    - Regression- To predict real numerical values (Prediction Model)
    - Classification - Putting data into categories (Spam coollection)


2. Unsupervised - Data is not labeled by human. Model needs to identify the pattern.
    - Clustering - recommendation 
    - annomaly detection 
3. Reinforced - Similar to a human. Generally take trial and error.

4. Deep Leaning - Immitating the human brain to solve a problem. 
   - Requires large dataset set 
   - Compute intensive 
   - Frameworks used - Tensor,Pytorch, Keras
   - Canbe downloaded as pre trained libraries.
   - Many models are already published.
