Categories of data science tools 
Initial steps are similar to that of analytics. Data passes through initial phases of 

Data science Task categories 
1. data management - The sources from which the data is collected after carefull considerations.
2. data integration and transformation - ETL(extrct,transct, load) activities. Data Warehouse - Creating aventral ref
3. data visualization - Visualisation maps etc 
4. model building - Train the data and analysing patterns using algorithms. Then we use it to make predictions
5. model deployment - Integrating into the production environment.
6. model monitoring and assessment - keeping the track of model performance on the data. 

Supporting the data Science Tasks 
- CODE Aset Management - VCS 
- Data Asset Management - Organising and managing data collected from different sources. 
- Execition environments 
- Development ENvironments - IDE - Develop, test and execute.

 
 Open source Tools 
1. data management - MySQL,postgre.  NOSQL mongo. File type - Hadoop
2. data integration and transformation - apache airflow, Kubeflow,Apache kafka,Apache Nifi, Apache Spark, Node red 
3. data visualization - Pixie Dust, Hue, Kibana, Tableu
4. model building - PredictionIO, Seldon, Mleap, Tensorflow.
5. Model Monitoring - ModelDB, Prometheus 
- Code asset management - Git, github, GitLab, bitBucket 
- data asset management - Apache atlas, Kylo 


best Developer environments - Jupyter 
- Encapsulates the environments of over 100 languages 
- Everything in one place 
- Jupyter Lab - Opening multiple tfiles 
- Apache Zeppelin - Better for Visualisation 
- R studio - LAready completed  

Best Execution Environment 
- Apache Spark - Same as googles paging. More the number of computers better the performance. Linear scale.
- Batch processing engine 
- Most amounts of data can be used 
- Riselab

Fully Integrated Visual tools 
- Encompasses data integration Data viz and model building 
- KNIME - Supports R and Python with connectors to Spark 

Common commercial tools for data science 
Data science Task categories 
1. data management - Oracle DB, MicrosoftSQL server, IBM DB2 
2. data integration and transformation - SAS Talend, Informatica IBM infospehere, Watson studio desktop 
3. data visualization - BI tools, Tableu, IBM Cognos Analytics 
4. model building - SPSS Modeler, SAS 
5. model deployment - 
6. model monitoring and assessment - Git and git hu. Limimted Same for data asset management
