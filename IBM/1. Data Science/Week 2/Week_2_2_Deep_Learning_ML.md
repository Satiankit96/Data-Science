1. Big Data - Huge data bases that defy the old techhniques. Using new knowledge to tackle these issues nad tackle the 5 V's.
2. Data Mining - Automatically searching and sorting the data. Normal analytics 
3. Machine learning - Machine learning is a subset of AI that uses computer algorithms to analyze data and make intelligent decisions based on what it is learned without being explicitly programmed. 
4. Deep learning is a specialized subset of machine learning that uses layered neural networks to simulate human decision-making.

Data science vs AI 
Data science is the process of extraxcting knowledge out of a huge data set. 
It's an interdisciplinary field involving mathematics, statistical analysis, data visualization, machine learning, and more.
This encompases the entire data processing methodology.
