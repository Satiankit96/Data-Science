Model - This can be defined as a mathematical equation to predict our target price 

Simple Liner Regression - Depends on a single variable to predict a relationship 
x - The predictor (independent) variable - x 
y = The Target(Dependent) variable -y 

y = mx + c (x = steepness of the line )
E = 1/n (sum(o->n)(yi - yi.)^2)    - This is the mean squared error. We need to minimise this 

Model Evaluation 
Horizontal axis - Independent Variable 
Vertical axis - dependent Variable (price)
Fitted line - Representation of the scattered points predicting the value
