Methodology - The decisions and steps that Data scienctist need to take in order to come to an conclusion.(These should e repeatable)
Asking Questions 
1. Business understanding - Define The issue 
2. analytic approach - How are we using Data to resolve that Issue 
3. data requirements - What data do we need to answer 
4. data collection - What is the data and where is it coming from 
5. Data understanding - Does the data collected represent the problem to be solved
6. data preparation - What additional work is required to manipulate the data 
7. modeling - Can we introduce an Model
8. evaluation - Does the modelanswer the initial issue
9. Deployment - Can this be put into practice
10. feedback - Can it be presented and gain some feedback 

Part 1 - Buisness Understanding 
- Take time to get more clarity. Even if it takes a bit more time in the beginning. 
- Be clear and chose the best idea that you have to resolve the main question. Maximising Profit or limiting the costs in a business. ()
The latter generally takes the back seat

Part 2 - analytic approach
- Identyfying what type of patterns dow we need to look into in order to resolve an question.
- Classification vs ML model Vs statistical vs Clusttering vs Decision Tree(Coupled with predictive model)
