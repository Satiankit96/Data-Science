Data Scientist
- Subject Matter expertize
- Curiosity to reach the use case

Dependency on a cloud 
- Its is a god send as all the data is centralised 
- Takes away the physical limitations 
- Can implement the complex algoritms in a central space 
- Same data can be used by multiple peoples 
- Most up to date tools are already there and we do not need to take care of many admin activities.
