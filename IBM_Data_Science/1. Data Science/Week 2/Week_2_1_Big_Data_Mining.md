Big Data - Big Data refers to the dynamic, large and disparate volumes of data being created by people, tools, and machines. It requires new, innovative, and scalable technology to collect, host, and analytically process the vast amount of data gathered in order to derive real-time business insights that relate to consumers, risk, profit, performance, productivity management, and enhanced shareholder value.

- Velocity - Speed at which the data is collected 
- volume - Scale of data. Increase in the amount of data
- variety - The diversity of data. Structured Unstructured. Differecnt sources. Internal and external. Other sources 
- veracity - Quality of the data collected - Better to have structured and 80 percent of the data is unstructured
- value - Data to value. What we get out of it at the end 


Hadoop 
Initially they sliced up the data into clusters and each computer will run its algo on these peices. Then these things were returned and reduced together. 
- These scale the data linearly. The more you slice the better the results.
- Hadoop is just the replica of the similar map and reduce principals but alittle more effective.

Data science vs Traditional subjects 
It was all there from the begining of the time.
Data science is just a direction to achieve what we want. now we have the computational capabilities to apply combine them and come up with new techniques and learning algorithms.

Data Science with digital transformation 
- Houston rockets use of the data 
- luftansa
- Netflix being one of the very first companies.
- an entire organisation needs to change for this to work. 

Data Mining 
- Extracting the large data set for analysis
- Unederstand the trade of between accuracy vs cost
- Pre-processing the data.
- Transforming the data - data reduction algo to shell out the parts not needed.
- Sorting the data - Saves the hassle for searching the data and makes mining easier.
- EValuating the minig results -  This is known as an “in-sample forecast”.
