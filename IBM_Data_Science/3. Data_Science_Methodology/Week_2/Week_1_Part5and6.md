3. Histograms 


Part 6 Data Preparaions
- Close to 70-90 percent of the time of the entire project.
- Automation can take out 50 percent of the time 
- Feature engineering - improving the features of the given data in order to improve the ML Algorithms.
- Text analysis - To look within the data.
- Use the iterative method while working with preparation and removing outliers to incorporate feature engineering.
